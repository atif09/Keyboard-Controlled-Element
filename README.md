## Movable Square – Mini Project
# About the Project
This is a simple interactive project where you can move a square around the screen using either the arrow keys or the W, A, S, D keys. It's a great way to get familiar with how JavaScript can interact with HTML and CSS to create real-time movement on a web page.

# How It Works
--> A cyan colored square appears on the screen.

--> When you press arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) or W, A, S, D, the square moves in that direction.

--> The square stays within a fixed boundary and won’t move outside of it.
