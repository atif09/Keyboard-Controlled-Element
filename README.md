## Movable Square â€“ Mini Project
# About the Project
This is a simple interactive project where you can move a square around the screen using either the arrow keys or the W, A, S, D keys. It's a great way to get familiar with how JavaScript can interact with HTML and CSS to create real-time movement on a web page.
